Python API HW 5 - UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp (Ai-Jiuan Wu ) 

Part I - WeatherPy
**Jupyter notebook Python script: WeatherPy_FINAL.ipynb**
A. 3 observable trends based on the weather data from 560 randomly selected cities around the world. (Script was run on 10/18/2020)
1. The temperature of a city is warmer as its located closer to the equator (latitude=0), irrelevant whether it is located in the Northern or Southern hemisphere.
2. The windspeed of a city is not correlated with its location in the Northern or Southern hemisphere and not with its distance from the equator.
3. The humidity of a city is not correlated with its location in the Northern or Southern hemisphere and not with its distance from the equator.

B. 4 csv files were generated from script, and they are as follows:
    all_cities.csv 
    cities_weather_data.csv (was used to run the VacationPy_FINAL.ipynb script - see Part II)
    Northerncities_weather_data.csv
    Southerncities_weather_data.csv

C. 12 fig files were generated from script, and they are as follows:
    cities_lat_cloudy.png
    cities_lat_humid.png
    cities_lat_temp.png
    cities_lat_wind.png
    Ncities_lat_cloud.png
    Ncities_lat_humid.png
    Ncities_lat_temp.png
    Ncities_lat_wind.png
    Scities_lat_cloud.png
    Scities_lat_humid.png
    Scities_lat_temp.png
    Scities_lat_wind.png

Part II - VacationPy
**Jupyter notebook Python script: VacationPy_FINAL.ipynb**
A. 2 fig files were generated from script, and they are as follows:
    heat_map.png - displays humidity for every city from Part I.
    heatmap_hotels.png - displays 2 hotels nearby 2 vacation cities with ideal weather conditions.
